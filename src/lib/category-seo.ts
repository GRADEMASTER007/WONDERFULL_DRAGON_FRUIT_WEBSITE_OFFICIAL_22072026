    seoContent: `<p>White-fleshed dragon fruit (<em>Selenicereus undatus</em>) is the most widely cultivated pitaya variety worldwide and the foundation of South Africa's growing dragon fruit industry. Known for its bright pink skin and crisp, sweet white interior speckled with tiny black seeds, this category showcases our finest white-flesh cultivars sourced and grown right here in Southern Africa.</p>

<p>At Dragon Fruit Farming Africa (DFSA), we supply premium unrooted cuttings of proven white-flesh varieties that thrive in South Africa's diverse climate zones — from the subtropical KwaZulu-Natal coast to the warm Limpopo lowveld. Our collection includes classic commercial cultivars such as <strong>Vietnamese White</strong>, <strong>David Bowie</strong>, <strong>Thomson</strong>, and many more exclusive genetics selected for yield, sweetness, and disease resistance.</p>

<p>White dragon fruit is the ideal entry point for new growers. These varieties are generally the hardiest, most productive, and easiest to pollinate. They produce reliably large fruit (300–600 g) and are well-suited to both home gardens and commercial operations. The fruit commands strong retail demand in South African supermarkets, restaurants, and export markets across Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, and beyond.</p>

<p>Every cutting ships fresh from our nursery with detailed planting instructions. Whether you're starting a backyard trellis or scaling a 5-hectare commercial farm, DFSA provides the genetics, knowledge, and ongoing support to help you succeed. Browse our white-flesh cultivars below and add to cart for fast nationwide delivery.</p>`,

    seoContent: `<p>Red and purple-fleshed dragon fruit varieties are the crown jewels of any pitaya collection. Their stunning deep magenta interior is packed with betalain antioxidants, making them the most sought-after cultivars for health-conscious consumers and premium markets across South Africa and the SADC region.</p>

<p>DFSA's red-flesh collection features top-performing cultivars including <strong>American Beauty</strong>, <strong>Physical Graffiti</strong>, <strong>Dark Star</strong>, <strong>Zamorano</strong>, and dozens more — each selected for exceptional colour intensity, sweetness (14–22 Brix), and commercial viability in Southern African growing conditions.</p>

<p>Red-flesh dragon fruit typically commands 30–50% higher prices than white varieties at retail, making them an excellent choice for farmers seeking premium market positioning. These cultivars often require cross-pollination for optimal fruit set, so we recommend planting multiple red-flesh varieties alongside compatible pollinators.</p>

<p>All cuttings are freshly harvested from mature mother plants at our South African nursery and shipped nationwide. Each order includes variety-specific growing notes and access to our farmer support network.

    seoContent: `<p>Yellow dragon fruit (<em>Selenicereus megalanthus</em>) is widely regarded as the sweetest and most flavourful pitaya species. With its distinctive yellow thorny skin and translucent white flesh, it commands the highest market prices of any dragon fruit variety — often R80–R150 per fruit at South African retail.</p>

<p>Our yellow-flesh collection at DFSA includes the legendary <strong>Palora</strong> (Ecuador's premium export cultivar), <strong>Colombian Gold</strong>, and other rare megalanthus genetics. These varieties produce smaller fruit (150–350 g) but deliver extraordinary sweetness levels of 18–24 Brix — far exceeding most red or white varieties.</p>

<p>Yellow dragon fruit grows somewhat differently from its pink-skinned cousins: it prefers slightly cooler conditions, takes longer to fruit (18–24 months from cutting), and benefits from careful irrigation management. However, the premium prices and market exclusivity make it a highly profitable crop for South African growers willing to invest the extra care.</p>

<p>DFSA ships fresh unrooted yellow dragon fruit cuttings nationwide across South Africa, with export available to Botswana, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Zambia, and Uganda. Each cutting comes with detailed megalanthus-specific growing instructions. Browse our yellow cultivar range below and secure your premium genetics today.</p>`,
